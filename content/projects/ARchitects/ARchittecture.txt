#  AR-chitecture

### Lane Macy & Abby Vendura

---

This is a project demonstrating a Revit model Deployed to the Tilt5.
![First Floor View] (/preview.jpg)

What is shown here is a previously completed Revit project that was used as the base model that was implemented into Unreal Engine 5. The reason that unreal Engine 5 was chosen was its workflow from Revit to unreal engine 5. There was also a workflow that formed from Unreal to the Tilt5

This project is a great way to show and explain a Revit file to people who are not proficient with interpreting floorplans, such as a client at a architecture firm, or an individual who does not work in architecture software.
